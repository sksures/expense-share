This code creates a simple Flask app with two database tables: User and Expense. The User table stores user information, and the Expense table stores expense information. The app has two routes: / and /add_expense. The / route displays a list of all expenses and users, and the /add_expense route allows users to add a new expense. The app uses SQLAlchemy to interact with the database and Jinja2 to render dynamic content.
